## What is Rustless?

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deuterium-orm/deuterium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deuterium-orm/deuterium)

Deuterium is a fancy SQL builder for Rust. It's designed to provide a DSL to easily build SQL queries in safe and *typed* way.

Like Rust itself, Deuterium is still in the early stages of development, so don't be surprised if APIs change and things break. If something's not working properly, file an issue or submit a pull request! 

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies.deuterium]
git = "https://github.com/deuterium-orm/deuterium"
```

## Examples?
